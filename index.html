          Hello, I am very glad to introduce myself on this web page ! Hello, my name is Apolline Urvoy, I am nineteen years old and i born on March 25, in 2004. 
          I am studying at the ESSEC Business School, located on the campus of Cergy in the Parisian region. I decided to pursue my academic career in business school because I have the ambition to work in the real estate sector. I really like this school, and I can't wait to discover what experiences it will allow me to have in the future.

        <h2>Where I come from?</h2>
        <p>
          I come from Saint-Brieuc in Brittany. I love this region, I have lived there since birth. Currently, I live in Cergy because my school is located there. My origins are primarily French, but also Polish, and English.

        <h2>My passions</h2>
        <p>
          Sports: I have been involved in sports since I was a child, including swimming for 12 years up to the national level, and then dancing for 13 years.
          Sharing moments with my friends and family: I love to feel surrounded by people every day. This year, I am living with 5 roommates who have become close to me; it is a pleasure for me to share my daily life with my friends. In fact, this year, I have had the opportunity to meet many new people from different parts of the world by moving to Cergy to pursue my studies, which is very enriching on a daily basis!

        <h2>What about travelling?</h2>
        <p>
          Travel and foreign cultures: I have already traveled to several countries with my parents since I was very young, which gave me a taste for travel! In fact, some of my family members live in foreign countries such as Spain, Ireland, Bolivia, and England. I have had the opportunity to visit them, and I love to familiarize myself with new cultures, which I find very enriching!

        <h2>What do I want to do in my future?</h2>
        <p>
          My choice to join a business school is not a coincidence. Indeed, I have the ambition to travel a lot in my life, and that is why I want to work internationally in my profession.
          One of my dreams would be to start my own real estate agency and establish it in different countries around the world! I hope that ESSEC will provide me with all the keys to realizing this dream!
          I would like to get back into sports as I used to in the past. Unfortunately, I had a fall while playing football that resulted in two major surgeries, which forced me to stop playing sports. However, these experiences have made me mature, and I am motivated to resume my sports practice as before!
          I would like to be able to get involved in a humanitarian cause, especially animal protection! I hope that in the future, I will be financially comfortable enough to undertake projects that are close to my heart to support causes that are important to me!"
